> Final course project specifications

## Usage

This repository contains all the *final project specifications* of the [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). 

The specifications are organized in folders corresponding to academic years (i.e., 2021 means academic year 2021/2022).

There may be several specifications for a single academic year. In this case, **You can freely choose one of the specifications relative to the year you attended the course**.

Specifications are written in Italian. **English translations**, if available, are marked with "\_EN\_" in the filename.

Each specification is provided in two **formats**:

- *Markdown*, to be easily read with the GitHub viewer directly on your web browser (just select the file to display it).
* *HTML* with embedded styles, to be easily exported to word processors, converted to PDF and printed (to download the HTML version, simply display the corresponding file, select "Raw" and save the file from your browser's menu).
